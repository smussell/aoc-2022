# Advent of Code 2022

[https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)


This contains my solutions setup for both JS and Clojure, I'm going to do as many as I can in clojure, but since I don't use it day to day I can usually solve much faster with JS so I'll do that as needed.

### .env

Before gettings started you'll need to grab your session id from the cookie and add it to the .env file. You'll also need to add the year.

##### example .env

```
AOC_SESSION_KEY=536...
YEAR=2022

```

### Solve 

To start a new day (works the same in either lang).  Once you run the start command your puzzle input is downloaded and a new source file is generated.

```
cd <clj-solutions or js-solutions>
npm start <day number>
```
